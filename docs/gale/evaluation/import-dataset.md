# Import Datasets

Evaluation Studio provides a flexible approach for importing and managing datasets, making it easier to evaluate model outputs. Users can upload datasets in CSV format. These datasets may contain:

* **Input-output pairs** (where each input has a corresponding output)
* **Input data only** (where outputs need to be generated by a user-defined model)

Evaluation Studio supports three scenarios for handling the datasets:

* **Scenario 1:** **One Input, One Output**: The simplest scenario where a dataset has one input column and one output column. Users map the input and output variables to run the evaluation, making it easy to evaluate model predictions.
* **Scenario 2:** **One Input, Multiple Outputs**: In more complex scenarios, one input may predict multiple outputs through different models. The dataset will have one input column and multiple output columns. Users map the input to the corresponding model outputs for evaluation. Also, users can upload ground truth columns to compare responses.
* **Scenario 3:** **Input Only**: In this scenario, the dataset contains only input data with no output columns. When users have input data but no corresponding outputs, they can generate model outputs using a pre-trained model. The system will automatically create a new output column based on the input, enabling users to evaluate the pre-trained model's generation.

## Adding Datasets to an Evaluation

Users can add datasets to evaluations within a project. Each dataset represents a collection of inputs and outputs for a specific use case.

Steps to import a dataset:

1. Navigate to Evaluation Studio.
2. Click the Projects tab, and choose the relevant project.
3. Select the specific evaluation to which you want to add datasets.

4. Click the **Upload file** link and select the CSV file saved on your local machine.

5. Check the preview of the dataset (first 10 rows). To confirm and finalize the import, click **Proceed**.

    The dataset is imported into Evaluation Studio and linked to the selected evaluation. You can then view your data in a tabular format in the evaluation table.

**Key Points:**

* A project can contain multiple evaluations, and users can add a dataset to any evaluation.
* Users can upload a dataset into the Evaluation Studio and run evaluations to measure model performance.
