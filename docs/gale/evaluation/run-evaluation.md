# Run Evaluations 

After setting up the evaluators and mapping the variables, you can begin the evaluation process to assess your model’s performance against the defined criteria.

To start an evaluation, click **Run** on the Evaluation page. The system will then assess the model’s output based on the provided input with the configured evaluators, displaying a 'Running evaluation' message as it works.

Once the evaluation is complete, the evaluator columns will be populated with scores, giving you a clear overview of the model’s performance.
